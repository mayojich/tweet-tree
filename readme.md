Most of the backend has been completed. [API endpoint](http://tweet-tree-backend.herokuapp.com/).

Now I've gotta figure out how to do the front end.

- [Figure out what this is](#figure-out-what-this-is)
- [Stuffs](#stuffs)

## One Step At A Time
1. Load and display json file locally.
2. Load and display backend API.
3. Do both with a tree map.

## Stuffs
- Data from `dummy.json` was from this [tweet](https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/1044304738186014720).
- Runs on heroku as a container.
- Uses hidden files that you need to prep yourself.
